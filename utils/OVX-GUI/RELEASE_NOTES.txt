Link cache now based entirely on src/dst DPID. Changes in linkId will not require flushing of link cache
	add/remove/change switch DPIDs will require reset of link cache
fixed error handling for update of physical model (would throw exception with respond, now retries)
proxy.js is now multi-threaded which should improve update speed
fixed update diff bug and now log changes to both phys and virt networks to js console on each refresh
Workaround for flowtable scroll position reset on update of "last updated" string (had to be absolutely positioned)
Restore currently selected switch in flowtable when syncing flowtable selection
Flowtable view updates if flowtable for the displayed switch changes. Also logs changes to js console

** Dec 3 2013
Handle changes in virtual network list (turned out to be simple)
Always show selected flow for physical network even if the flow is not used by current virtual network
Host and Switch mouseover tooltips in both virtual and physical view
Implement link up/down interactions (double click link) and physical link caching

** Dec 2 2013
Better flowtable highlighting: both selected switch and flowtable contents are green
After startping/stopping immediately update the display to draw pending actions (still waits on SVG layout API)
Format actions in flowtable (instead of raw JSON)
Add selection state for flowtable rows and highlight selected flows in physical and virtual topology views
Added readable mouseover tooltips (the default Chrome popups are too small.)

** Nov 27 2013
Drag from host to host to start ping
Stop ping button for whole network
Pending display state (flashing orange) for flowpaths that are starting or stopping

Finishec CSS refator
?skin=light gets a dark on light skin suitable for conference room projector
	without parameter defaults to light on dark (suitable for LCD panels)
UI is now served through
	http://localhost:5000/static/index.html
OR for light-on-dark skin:
	http://localhost:5000/static/index.html?s=light
To start server:
	$ cd <path-to-ovx-gui>/webapp
	$ python proxy.py
Add IP labels for hosts


** Nov 25 2013
Refactored CSS and graphviz layout parameters (switch, host size) for easier skinning
Moved graphviz size parameters (host and switch size) to client/js/graphvizLayoutParameters.js
Virtual networks selectors are now laid out across the top of the virtual topology display

** Nov 22 2013
Made the switch and host size larger in the virtual view to help distinguish virtual/physical and make the views less "spindly"
Auto refresh working except for:
	flow table displays stale data

** Nov 21 2013
Various improvements and code refactoring

** Nov 20 2013
Overlay "core" switches on US map using lat/lng from data/layout.js
Set initial position for subgraph switches to the final position of the root (core) of the subgraph. Then let neato do the rest
Pin virtual hosts to their corresponding position in the physical topology view
Set initial position for virtual switches to the centroid of the corresponding physical switches in the physical topo view
Merged from links branch

** Nov 13 2013
Use hot spots for switch magnifier cursor so mag is centered on switch
Don't dim internal links from big switches and highlight them on mouseover a virtual switch
Don't dim physical switches which are referenced from physical links which are referenced from the virtual link map
	and highlight these on mouseover of a virtual link

** Nov 12 2013
Click to show switch in flowtable inspector

** Nov 8 2013
Show both virtual and physical hosts in topology
Highlight physical host and uplink when mousing over virtual host and uplink
Show virtual and physical flows in topology view
Highlight the physical flows which match flows in the current virtual network

** Oct 28 2013
Use new virtual link map format (physical links for both directions)
Show hosts in virtual topology

** Oct 15 2013
Created larger mouseoever area for edges
Better css for edges so that they don't overlap nodes. Standardize stroke width.

** Oct 15 2013
Hook up to virtualSwitchMapping and virtualLinkMapping APIs
Implement mouseover event handling to highlight the mapping virtual/physical mappings for links and switches


** Oct 4 2013
First commit
Cloned parts of the ONOS app to create consistent look for the shell
Created basic proxy and layout service based on GraphViz/pygraphviz
UI gets and displays the physical topology on load, gets and displays virtual topologies when the virtual topology selector changes
Lots of cleanup needed (removing the unused bits of the ONOS code)
