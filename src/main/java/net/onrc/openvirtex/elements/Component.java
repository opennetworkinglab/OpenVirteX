 * <ul>
 * <li>INIT - just initialized, not accessible or usable</li>
 * <li>ACTIVE - capable of handling events and accumulating state (flow entries,
 * counters), etc.</li>
 * <li>INACTIVE - halted, not capable of handling events or accumulating state
 * (e.g. a downed interface)</li>
 * <li>STOPPED - removed from network representation (e.g. a failed switch)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Some Components can influence the state of other Components (subcomponents)
 * with their own. In general, a subcomponent's state won't affect the
 * component, but the reverse is not true e.g. ports are removed if a switch is
 * removed, but a switch port can be removed without affecting the whole switch.
